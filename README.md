# My favorite TV series/movie

one of my favorite movies which i am still astonished about up to this day is a movie called **Fury**. It is a movie depicting the life of a sherman tank crew during the final days of the war facing numerous enemies and sacrificing their lives for the sake of their comrades, showing the real brutality of war in the eyes of man. 

- Here are the following notable characters in the movie:
1. Brad Pitt (Don "WarDaddy" Collier)
2. Shia LaBeouf (Boyd "Bible" Swan)
3. Logan Lerman (Norman Ellison)
4. Michael Pe√±a (Trini "Gordo" Garcia)
5. jon Bernthal (Grady "Coon-Ass" Travis)
